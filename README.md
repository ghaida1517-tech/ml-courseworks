# Machine Learning Courseworks

A collection of **educational ML projects** built during the Machine Learning course at UQU.

## ðŸ“˜ Included Works
- **Regression Assignment:** Ridge vs Linear Regression comparison  
- **Classification Assignment:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN  
- **Data Preprocessing & Evaluation:** Normalization, binning, smoothing, visualization  

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals
- Understand model performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- Apply and compare models using real-world student performance data
- Write clear, reproducible notebooks with comments and results
